## This project should help me and my classmates to pass the final exam in our school.

So, we have above 500+ exam questions and every classmate has assigned 8 questions. Every classmate must solve this 
8 questions before he got access to all questions solved by another classmates. Simple? Ha?

I know there are a lot of boilerplate code, a lot of mistakes but I don't have time.
